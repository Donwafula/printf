<h3>Format of the Argument String</h3>
The format string argument is a constant character string composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (apart from %) which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
Conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with a conversion specifier (which in whole make up the format specifier.)
